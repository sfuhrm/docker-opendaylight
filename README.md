OpenDaylight is a SDN controller. It can be used to control and orchestrate a network of switches.

OpenDaylight supports many southbound protocols and can be integrated in Openstack or even Kubernetes.

## What's inside

- A ready-to-use OpenDaylight instance that will start up as a server. Multiple OpenDaylight versions are provided as tags.
- The images are based on [`openjdk:11-jre-slim-buster`](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk) for OpenDaylight 10+ and `openjdk:8-jre-slim-buster` for older versions.
- No features are installed (you can install modules at boot time by setting the [`KARAF_FEATURES`](#customization-via-env-variables) env variable).
- Exposed TCP ports:
  - 6633 Openflow,
  - 8101 Karaf CLI via SSH (see below),
  - 8181 RESTCONF / HTTP

## How to use it

A typical use-case will be starting docker with several environment variables to prepare the container in a way that you have a readily
configured OpenDaylight instance with the features you need.

### Run the container

`docker run -d -p 6633:6633 -p 8101:8101 -p 8181:8181 --name=opendaylight stephanfuhrmannionos/opendaylight`

### Access OpenDaylight Karaf CLI

#### Using SSH

To access the Karaf CLI, issue the command

`ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -p 8101 karaf@localhost`

The default SSH credentials are:

- Username: `karaf`
- Password: `karaf`

Note: `StrictHostKeyChecking` and `UserKnownHostsFile` file is turned off because different container invocations will have different host keys.

#### Using Docker

An interactive Karaf shell can also be spawned with the following command line:

```bash
docker exec -ti opendaylight bin/client
```

where `opendaylight` is the name of the running container.

## Customization via ENV variables

The following environment variables can be set to customize the started
server:

| Variable                | Default   |  Possible Values |   |
|-------------------------|-----------|------------------|---|
| `KARAF_INTERACTIVE`     | `0`       | `0`,`1`              | Set to `1` to run Karaf interactive, meaning that the docker instance will be interactive. As an alternative, you can connect in a running server instance using `docker exec -ti opendaylight /odl/bin/client`  |
| `KARAF_FEATURES`        |           | string           | Comma separated features to load on boot of OpenDaylight. Example: `odl-yangtools-parser,odl-yangtools-parser-api` |
| `KARAF_USER`            | `karaf`   | string           | The user name of the Karaf service.  |
| `KARAF_PASSWORD`        | `karaf`   | string           | The password of the Karaf service.  |
| `ODL_LOGLEVEL`          | `INFO`    | `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL` |  The log level to log runtime information to the Docker console with.  |
| `ODL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`    | `admin`   | string           |  The password of the AAA admin user.  |

Example:

```bash
docker run  -e KARAF_USER=michael -e KARAF_PASSWORD=knight -p 6633:6633 -p 8101:8101 -p 8181:8181 --name=opendaylight stephanfuhrmannionos/opendaylight:latest
```
